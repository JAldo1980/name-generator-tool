<h2>Kill Team Generator</h2>

<p>Small hobby blog build</p>
<p>This is a code snippet for a Kill Team Generator, which randomly generates names, operatives, demeanours, and base operations for a fictional kill team. The generated results are displayed in HTML elements on a webpage.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

This code relies on several HTML elements with specific IDs. 

kill-team-name-btn: Button element used to generate a random kill team name.
kill-team-output: Element to display the generated kill team name.
operative-names-btn: Button element used to generate random operative names.
operative-name-output1 to operative-name-output12: Elements to display the generated operative names.
demeanours-btn: Button element used to generate random demeanours.
quirk-output: Element to display the generated demeanour.
bkground-output: Element to display the generated background.
base-output: Element to display the generated base operation.
base-text-a, base-text-b, base-text-c: Elements to display additional information about the generated base operation.

<h3>Generating Kill Team Name</h3>

Clicking the kill-team-name-btn button will generate a random kill-team name. The generated name will be displayed in the kill-team-output element.

<h3>Generating Operative Names</h3>

Clicking the operative-names-btn button will generate random operative names. The generated names will be displayed in the operative-name-output1 to operative-name-output12 elements.

<h3>Generating Demeanours</h3>

Clicking the demeanours-btn button will generate a random demeanour. The generated demeanour will be displayed in the quirk-output element.

<h3>Generating Base Operations</h3>
The code includes predefined arrays of demeanours, backgrounds, and base operations. The generated results are displayed in the quirk-output, bkground-output, base-output, base-text-a, base-text-b, and base-text-c elements.

<h3>Customisation</h3>

You can customize the predefined arrays of kill team names, operative names, demeanours, backgrounds, and base operations by modifying the corresponding arrays in the JavaScript code. Update the arrays with your own values or add new elements to suit your needs.
